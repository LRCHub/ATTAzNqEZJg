[00:08.00] I am using my imagination
[00:20.50] 
[00:09.82] I wanted strength, I wanted luck
[00:12.43] I wanted money and fame
[00:15.14] I wanted everyone to love me and be under my reign
[00:20.64] And when an arrow dipped in poison hit the path that I take
[00:26.11] I knew I never had a choice and it was all up to fate
[00:52.61] 
[00:31.66] To pay the cost to chase a dream, I started starin' at a screen
[00:37.18] Now I know everything, boy, I know everything
[00:42.66] And now I'm tearin' at the seams and only God can hear my screams
[00:48.19] 'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything
[01:12.19] 
[00:53.77] Oh, how I'm learnin' like a fool, I'm always uppin' the pace
[00:58.95] I said, we're chasin' somethin' beautiful or get out my way (me)
[01:04.48] Through all the power trips, the cowardice, the pleasure and pain
[01:09.95] I found that me, God and the devil are all one in the same
[01:15.52] I'm at my end (you're a monster)
[01:18.92] You told me from the start
[01:24.48] I'm making evil art (yeah)
[01:37.48] 
[01:26.37] Why you actin' like you my friend? You know nothin' about me
[01:29.44] I'm ready to ascend, you could double the bounty
[01:32.36] But fuckers all pretend that they didn't doubt me
[01:35.05] I'm stickin' to the plan, bitch, I'm movin' devoutly
[01:37.94] I've already found me, you all love to waste time
[01:40.50] I'm hearin' it loudly, climbing up the grapevine
[01:43.26] I'm up in the canopy, waiting for the bassline
[01:46.01] Invert the polarity, put a hole in spacetime
[02:08.01] 
[01:48.77] To pay the cost of my regime, I started starin' at a screen
[01:53.93] Now I know everything (king), boy, I know everything
[01:59.68] And now I'm tearin' at the seams and only God can hear my screams
[02:04.91] 'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything
[02:28.91] 
[02:21.04] Back out, back out, fuck!
[02:33.54] 
[02:34.52] I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (The ritual is now complete)
[02:39.71] I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (Ooh, oh, oh)
[02:45.06] I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (A noble sacrifice)
[02:50.86] I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted
[03:19.86] 
[02:58.35] Open your eyes
[03:01.91] Open your eyes, just breathe
[03:09.07] Breathe, don't look up
[03:17.12] I don't wanna lose you
[03:25.49] Stop, talk to me
